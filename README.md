# Reviewr â€” Libguide Review Tool

Reviewr is an application to register and communicate changes to Libguides authors.

### Replace Author Emails / names in The Guide Author Dropdown

To populate your own names and emails in the Guide Author Dropdown, simply replace the names and emails in the _authors.json_ file in the _json_ directory.

### Replace the Checkboxed Criteria

To replace the various criteria will take some coding work. It's not terribly difficult, an I'm happy to answer questions about how to get started on that.
